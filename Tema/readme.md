## Solved exercises

- Exercises 1, 2 and 4 have been attempted


## Notes

- Exercises 1, 2 and 4 are solved
- Exercise 4 runs extremely slow (it takes ~5 seconds for a frame to be processed on my machine)
- For exercise 4, the way to run the script is as follows: ```python ex4.py --input-path {input_video_path} --output-path {output_video_path}```. Both paths should point to a valid video file.
